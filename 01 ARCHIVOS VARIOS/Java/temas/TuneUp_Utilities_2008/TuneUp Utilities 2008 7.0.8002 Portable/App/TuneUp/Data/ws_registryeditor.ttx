Welcome to TuneUp Registry Editor
<h1>Welcome to TuneUp&nbsp;Registry&nbsp;Editor</h1>

<p>TuneUp Registry Editor is a powerful and comfortable tool for editing the Windows registry.</p>

<p>Navigating the registry becomes very easy thanks to modern features such as bookmarks, history lists and a comfortable search function.</p>

<p>The function "Goto key" allows keys to be called up quickly on the basis of their path, a particularly handy 
feature that makes it easier to work with tips from magazines and the Internet.</p>

<p>All changes to your system are logged in TuneUp Rescue Center and can be undone later if required.</p>
