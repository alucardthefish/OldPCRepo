<p>Over time, errors may occur in the file system of your computer - due to defects in the drives being used, power outages or software crashes.</p>
<p>If these errors are not quickly found and corrected, this can lead to error messages, application problems and, in the worst case, total loss of important files.</p>
<p>TuneUp Disk Doctor performs a thorough analysis of your disk drives and their file systems. If errors are found during analysis, they can be repaired to prevent data loss.</p>
