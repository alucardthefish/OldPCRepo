Welcome to TuneUp Memory Optimizer
<h1>Welcome to <nobr>TuneUp Memory Optimizer</nobr></h1>

<p>TuneUp Memory Optimizer monitors your system in the background and frees 
up memory whenever necessary to increase the performance of your system.</p>

<p>When your system runs out of available memory, TuneUp Memory Optimizer instructs 
the system to free memory for your applications and move unnecessary 
data to the virtual memory on the hard disk.</p>

<p>Thanks to our SmartOptimize technology, the automatic optimization process
is completed in the background without disturbing your work. SmartOptimizer makes sure
that optimization processes are only carried out when your processor is not 
busy.</p>
