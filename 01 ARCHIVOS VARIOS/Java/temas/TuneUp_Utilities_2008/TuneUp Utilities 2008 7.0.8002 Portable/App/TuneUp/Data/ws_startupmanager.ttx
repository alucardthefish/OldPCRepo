Welcome to TuneUp StartUp Manager
<h1>Welcome to TuneUp&nbsp;StartUp&nbsp;Manager</h1>

<p>You can use TuneUp StartUp Manager to speed up your system by
preventing the automatic loading of undesired applications at startup.</p>

<p>Many programs start automatically with the Windows system without 
requesting confirmation. The <nobr>higher the number</nobr> of applications 
that are loaded automatically, the slower your system will be.</p>

<p>TuneUp StartUp Manager presents all settings in a single
window, putting an end to wasted system performance. Just
deselect the checkbox in front of each undesired application 
to prevent it from loading automatically at system startup.</p>
