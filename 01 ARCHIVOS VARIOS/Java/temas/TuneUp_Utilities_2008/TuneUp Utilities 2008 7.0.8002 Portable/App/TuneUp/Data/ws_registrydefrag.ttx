Welcome to TuneUp Registry Defrag
<h1>Welcome to <nobr>TuneUp Registry Defrag</nobr></h1>

<p>TuneUp Registry Defrag analyzes the structure of your registry and rebuilds it 
completely from scratch if needed. The registry is defragmentated, and any structural
errors are corrected.</p>

<p>Defragmentation makes the files that comprise your registry smaller and
more compact. This reduces the amount of data that Windows loads into
the memory and significantly speeds up access to the information in the registry.</p>

<p>Run TuneUp Registry Defrag regularly to improve the performance of your system
and to avoid system crashes and the loss of data.</p>
