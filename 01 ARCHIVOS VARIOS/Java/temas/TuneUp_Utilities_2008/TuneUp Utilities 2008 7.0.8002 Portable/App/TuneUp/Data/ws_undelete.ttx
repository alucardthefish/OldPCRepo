<h1>Welcome to TuneUp&nbsp;Undelete</h1>

<p>TuneUp Undelete searches your disks for
deleted files and can recover them when instructed to do so.</p>

<p>When a file is deleted and removed from the Recycle Bin, its data
is still present and available on the disk as long as the space
it occupies is not written over with other data.</p>

<p>TuneUp Undelete finds the remains of deleted files and can restore
the contents that have not yet been overwritten.</p>

<p>If you delete an important file by mistake, launch TuneUp Undelete
immediately. This often allows your important data to be saved.</p>
