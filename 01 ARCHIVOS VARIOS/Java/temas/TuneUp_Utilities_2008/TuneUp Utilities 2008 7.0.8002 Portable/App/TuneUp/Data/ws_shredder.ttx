Welcome to TuneUp Shredder
<h1>Welcome to TuneUp&nbsp;Shredder</h1>

<p>TuneUp Shredder can be used to delete files and folders permanently,
making sure the data cannot be recovered by hackers or unauthorized persons.</p>

<p>When the normal Windows file delete process is used, a deleted file 
is only marked as "deleted" in the Windows file allocation table, 
and Windows no longer displays the file. But its contents are still present 
on the disk and can be restored, for example with TuneUp Undelete, without problems.</p>

<p>TuneUp Shredder uses a method developed by the US Department of Defense
to ensure that files and folders are permanently removed from your hard disk, so that
your sensitive data can no longer be recovered, even with the use of special software.</p>
