all programs in the TuneUp Utilities package, keeping track of all changes 
made to your system at all times.</p>

<p>If your system no longer functions properly after changes are made
to your configuration, you can undo these changes with TuneUp RescueCenter.</p>

<p>Under Windows XP/Vista, TuneUp Rescue Center also offers access to the
